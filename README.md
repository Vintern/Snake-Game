# Python.4 Snake Game(Both .py and .exe)
 My first ever game project in Python. Mostly looked through the internet. It is very basic and smiliar to other regular games in python.
 The code itself is perfect to exercise for beginners.
 To make the .py to .exe i used Pyinstaller (like everyone does). Which is you can find it here: https://datatofish.com/executable-pyinstaller/
 You can add some new options into this code. Such as like "score saving system". It is updateable and perfect to work, exercise on codes.
 In this purpose i tried to write in a good line shape with explanations on code headers. Such as (Screen, Snake of the head etc.). You can find it them by '#' keyword.
 KNOWN BUG: The game itself runs on a 600x600 angle window. So even if you fullscreen the window game will continue to work in 600x600. That means that snake will hit to ghost walls and die. You can easily fix this bug. I prefer not fixing becuse as i said, beginners can work on this.
 Also you can check it out how i add an icon to the .exe file from here: https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html
 T-t-t-that's all folks.
